# Blockchain19Web
## Project Mission / Motiviation

There is limited visibility within the medical supply chain when it comes to receiving medications or vaccinations. From manufacturers, logistics, hospitals/clinics, and recipients there is a lack of transparency with the process that causes errors, waste of resources (money and time), and are more susceptible to data breaches.

## Project Objective
We will work with Jonathan and Matt from the DMDC to make a program that will track and verify the status and process of a COVID-19 vaccination in a decentralized manner utilizing some form of Blockchain by the end of this semester.

## Project Approach
- We would need to do research on the process of a COVID-19 vaccination from start to finish. Then decide on which portion of that supply chain we wish to implement the blockchain technology to.
- Afterwards we will apply the agile development and create user stories. This will help divide up the work of the project.
- For this project we will be using Java. Our team is most familiar with Java. Since blockchain is a new concept for all of us, we decided to choose a language that we would not struggle with.
- We will also be using Google cloud platform. Using a platform is common in the industry and we wanted to apply this to our project.

## Dependencies / Risks
- Dependencies:
  - The usage of SHA-256, RSA encryption scheme
  - Understanding the blockchain model.
  - Learning and refreshing on java and the Google cloud platform we would be using.
- Risk:
  - Blockchain not working as expected, or potentially less efficient than existing databases and tracking methods.

## Project Deliverables
- Blockchain-powered tracker for supply chain management
- A document comparing the performance of blockchain compared to other databases

# Pre-Requisites

 - See https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html.
       https://github.com/charliekid/Blockchain19
- Install NodeJS, Node Package Manger(NPM)
    Download NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Install ExpressJS,Axios, Nodemon via NPM
    'npm install express'
    'npm install nodemon'
    'npm install axios'
    
# Usage

## Running the web app in IntelliJ

Find built-in terminal within IntelliJ. If not already, navigate to the project folder.
Once there, assuming all dependencies/prerequisites have been installed, in the command line run: 'npx nodemon' or 'npm start'.

Main difference: 'npx nodemon' you only run once and for each code change one can just refresh the page and continue working
                 'npm start' run each time you change your code
